# Task 
Design and implement a parallel program that optimizes the performance of a
simulated bank account system. The program should have the following features:

1. Multiple threads/processes that can deposit and withdraw money from the
account concurrently.
2. A shared variable that stores the current balance of the account.
3. A synchronization mechanism (e.g. locks, semaphores, condition variables) to
ensure safe access to the shared balance.
4. A performance metric (e.g. throughput, latency, efficiency) to measure the
program's performance.

# Requirements
- Design and implement a parallel program that meets the above requirements.
- Conduct experimentation to measure the program's performance under different
scenarios (e.g. varying number of threads/processes, transaction rates, etc.).
- Analyze and interpret the data collected during experimentation to identify trends,
patterns, and correlations.
- Optimize the program's performance by adjusting the synchronization
mechanism, thread/process scheduling, or other design parameters.

# Deliverables
- A written report that describes the program's design, implementation, and
experimentation methodology.
- A set of graphs or charts that visualize the program's performance metrics under
different scenarios.
- A set of recommendations for optimizing the program's performance based on
the analysis of the experimental data.

# Grading Criteria
- Design and implementation (30 points): Does the program meet the
requirements? Is the design efficient and effective?
- Experimentation and data analysis (30 points): Are the experiments
well-designed and executed? Is the data analysis thorough and insightful?
- Optimization and recommendations (20 points): Are the optimization recommendations based on sound analysis and evidence? Are the recommendations practical and feasible?
- Writing and presentation (20 points): Is the written report clear, concise, and
well-organized? Are the graphs and charts effective in communicating the
results?

# Tips and Hints
- Use a systematic approach to design and implement the program.
- Use a variety of tools and techniques to collect and analyze data (e.g. profiling,
benchmarking, simulation).
- Consider using a design of experiments (DOE) approach to optimize the
program's performance.
 -Use visualization techniques to communicate complex data insights effectively.
